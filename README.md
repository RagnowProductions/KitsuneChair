# KitsuneChair
In order to build a KitsuneChair, here's what you need:
## Ingredients

- Superglue or strong fabric tape (Reinforcements)
- Thread (Sewing it together)
- Air pump (optional)
## Steps

- Tape the nozzle to either the front or side of the fabric
- Superglue it in place
- Superglue and tape the edges
- Sew the edges together
- Inflate the chair
- Fold the chair into an L shape
- Superglue the bungee cables from the bottom to the top
- Deflate it
